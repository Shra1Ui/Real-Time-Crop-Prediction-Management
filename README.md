# Real-Time Crop Prediction & Management

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil parameters such as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
The aim is to help farmers, agronomists, or agricultural platforms make data-driven decisions to enhance crop yield and farming efficiency.

## ✅ What I Did

### Data Preprocessing

* Loaded the crop dataset using Pandas
* Cleaned the data, handled missing values (if any)
* Normalized features for better model performance

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Visualized feature distributions and relationships
* Identified key features influencing crop recommendations

### Model Building

* Trained multiple classification models:

  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Compared models using accuracy and confusion matrices

### Model Tuning

* Applied hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
* Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### Model Saving

* Serialized the trained model using `pickle` as `model.pkl`

### Prediction Interface (Optional)

* Built a simple script (`app.py`) to load the model and test with real inputs (manual or form-based)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA & visualization)
* scikit-learn
* Pickle
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

**1. Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-prediction-ml.git
cd crop-prediction-ml
```

**2. Install Requirements:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Run the Notebook:**
Open `model.ipynb` and execute cells to train and evaluate the model.

**4. Optional – Make Predictions:**

```bash
python app.py
```

## 📊 Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of **X%** (replace with actual). The **Random Forest** classifier (or best model) was chosen for its robustness and high performance.

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

* Integrate real-time weather and soil APIs
* Deploy as a full web application
* Include support for seasonal and regional variability
* Expand to cover more crops and larger datasets
